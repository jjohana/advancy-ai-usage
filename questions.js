      {
        "text": "A rules engine that follows fixed business logic and always gives the same deterministic answer.",
        "why": "Incorrect. The training distinguishes LLMs from rules engines; they generate likely text rather than following fixed rules."
      },
      {
        "text": "An optimization solver that computes a guaranteed best answer for every consulting problem.",
        "why": "Incorrect. The training explicitly says an LLM is not an optimization solver and does not compute a guaranteed best answer."
      },
      {
        "text": "A database that only retrieves exact sentences from approved source documents.",
        "why": "Incorrect. Retrieval can be added through tools, but an LLM itself generates text from patterns and context."
      },
      {
        "text": "A calculator designed mainly to verify numbers and formulas without human review.",

    "correct": 2,
    "options": [

      {
        "text": "As final if it includes citations, because citations remove the need for review.",
